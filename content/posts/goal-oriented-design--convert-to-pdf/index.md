Me and basically everyone else I know uses Whatsapp to exchange texts. One of the most important features of the app is the ability to create **groups** - it's what made it become famous in the first place, together with it being free to use.

The way you create a group is pretty straightforward: press the “+” icon, press on “New group”, select the people that should be part of the group, and choose a name (“subject”) to finish the job. What else could you ask for?

This is all well and good, but it assumes two things:
- That I can only add people whose number is saved on my phone;
- That I don't have a better way of locating those contacts than typing their name.

I find that this is often not the case. A common situation that I find myself into is wanting to create a group B, containing all the people that are in group A except some.

Think about birthdays: a friend creates a group for their birthday to share information about where and when the party will be and some other things. You want to get a group gift to that friend, so you want an easy way to communicate with everyone but the birthday boy.

Now what you have to do is:
- Open the birthday group to see who has been invited
- One by one, save the contacts of people you don't know, assigning them random names
- Make a list somewhere (preferably not on your phone) of all the contacts
- Finally create the group, looking at the list and inserting people one by one
- Receive a text from someone saying that you missed some people
- Promote them to admin and let them fix things because you can't be bothered anymore

All these steps make for a complicated [Gulf of execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things#Gulf_of_execution), which is not a good thing.

To put it simply: too many steps are required to accomplish a simple task, and the order of those steps does not resemble my intention.

This is a very complicated way of saying that Whatsapp should receive a new way of creating groups based on the desired flow of actions that one has in contexts like these. One that lets you translate the thought "I want to take some people from a group and put them into another group" directly into a sequence of steps.

Maybe, in some distant future, we might be able to look at the list of participants in a group and tap on checkboxes right next to each name, then press on a button that says "Add to group".

Then, it would show us a list of groups, and we will be able to select an existing one, or press on "Create new".
