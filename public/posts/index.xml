      <description>You are on a street, one person coming towards you from your right, another from your left. You know that, when they will have reached you, one of them will tell the truth and one will lie.

It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you ask &amp;ldquo;should I trust the person coming from the right?</description>
